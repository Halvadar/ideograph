# AI Discussion Graph

An interactive diagram-based AI chat application that enables branching conversations and idea development.

## Overview

This application provides a unique way to explore ideas through AI-powered conversations that can branch into multiple discussion threads. Each conversation starts as a single node and can split into multiple branches based on different subjects identified in the AI's responses.

### Core Features

1. **Visual Conversation Flow**: Discussions visualized as interactive graph nodes using D3.js
2. **Dynamic Branching**: Automatic splitting of responses into multiple branches based on subject matter
3. **Multi-threaded Discussions**: Ability to maintain separate conversation threads from each branch
4. **Interactive Graph Interface**: Users can navigate, expand, and interact with different conversation branches
